# This a heading(h1)

## This is a smaller heading (h2)

### This is the same as an H3

#### Be sure to add a space after the pound sign (h4)

##### We can us Ctrl-Shift-V to use the default markdown viewer in VS Code

###### H6 always add line breaks after headings

I am a paragraph do not indent me! Just start writing on a new line add trailing-white space aka add three spaces to the end of the line like so   
now I am on a new line

or we can leave a Full space between lines to start a new paragraph or we can even use HTML in Markdown and use the `<br>` tag: <br> I am on a new line

You can write in **bold** or in *italics* or ***both at the same time***

    We can even put our texts in boxes with an indent!!!

## Lists

We can make ordered lists:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

the numbering does not matter as long as you start with 1
1. item 1
1. itme 2
1. item 3
2. item 4
7. item 5

We can make unordered list:
- first item
- second itme
- third item

## HR

```

## More Information

There are a lot of different flavors of markdown out there for instance Github has their own flavor.  These commands should be universal though to all mark down languages.

There are more options you can learn like embedding these elements inside eachother, making footnotes, task lists, definitions lists ect. If you want to learn more about markdown visit:
[Markdown Home Page](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

There is also an extended syntax that is availible in many markdown applications that I have not shown here.  You can learn more at the Markdown homepage by scrolling to Extended Syntax section of the markdown website.

The links to the parts of the page in this document is designed to work with Github and may not work with all markdown applications.  for more info on github's flavor of markdown [Check out this page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
